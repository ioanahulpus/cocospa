A contact network is a minimal social network in which people are not assumed to have any relationship other than to be able to contact each other - perhaps only to refer items of mutual interest in politics or business , that imply no longstanding collaboration or relationship or trust with each other .
Study of contact networks is central to advertising and marketing and political marketing and public relations in particular , since spreads of rumor and hearsay are thought to follow contact networks closely . A phone tree or buddy list for instance , especially when combined with technologies such as SMS and flash mobs , are well known ways to spread requests , rumors or news .
Unlike social networks , once the rumor is passed on , the ability to rein it in or restrict or qualify it may be very limited . Members of a contact network do not in general follow up claims or issues with each other as members of social networks do ( or are thought to do ) .
Contact networks are also thought central to power network analysis because people ally , for purposes of achieving power ( sociology ) , even with those with whom they have no social contact , do not like , and would otherwise not work with at all . A contact is thus something less even than a `` weak friend '' or acquaintance .
More than 200 such weak friends can exist in a true social network , but contact networks can be much larger - and are subject to such odd concepts as `` customer relationship management . ''
Technologically , contact networks have tended to expand with the ease of sending and receiving people 's contact information . Some semantic link conventions such as hCard have developed to facilitate just such a spread . Most Personal Information Manager tools also handle contact networks easily , even if they have poor facilities for handling relationships as social network services tend to specialize in .
Receiving or facilitating spam is thought to be often a consequence of having many contacts , as a penetrated email account can often be used to spread much of it , without the contact necessarily complaining to the sender , as they would in a true social network .
